															Dear Inner Wheel Friends,
														</p>
														<p>
This year’s Theme is taken from our second objective “to encourage the ideals of personal service”</p>
<p>Touch a Heart, gives birth to kindness, being generous with your time, money, resources and willingness to help.  Your true wealth is the good you do in the world.  Be kind to earth, honour the idea of a global community, that we are each other’s keepers, ensuring safety, security, comfort, wellness, beauty and peace.  Be kind to yourself, take care of your body by eating well, it goes through to the heart.   Be kind with your words.  Words spoken are like a broken egg, you cannot park them back.  Be careful your word do not hurt your heart and the heart of others around you.</p>

<p>Touch a Heart, applies to our relationship with other people, animal, plants, and the Earth.  It may be offering of helping hand, patiently waiting your turn, returning a phone call or favour, or even cheerfully responding with a smile.  You can touch a heart by listening, not necessarily giving advice, just listening to someone pouring emotions out, with patience.  Giving someone a part on the back, a warm hug, when there is no one to acknowledge, can give the courage to move a mountain.  A wink of an eye that means you can do it.</p>
<br />Touch a Heart through the way you treat your environment, the trees are our lungs, the rivers our bloodstream, they are all inter connected and what you do to environment ultimately you do to yourself.  Kindness in the way we handle our environment, the oxygen we breathe works through our lungs and fuel our blood through our heart.
<br />
We can give compassion through “Touch a Heart”, an essential part of our life.   The smile expressed by the recipient of your kindness is an experience more powerful than words.   To become acquitted with touching a heart, one must be prepared to learn new things, and feel new feelings. <br />


Touch a Heart is more than a philosophy of mind, it is a philosophy of the Spirit.<br />
