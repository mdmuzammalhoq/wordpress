															Hello! friends,

														</p>

														<p>

															It&rsquo;s a matter of great pride and joy that District 328 has launched its Website.

															<br />

															As one of the very founder members of Inner Wheel in Bangladesh its heartening to be a part of every happening in the District.&nbsp; The progress made since its inception is laudable and noteworthy.

														</p>

														<p>

															Congratulations! Chairman Tahera Muzaffar for having the vision and warm felicitation to District Editor Sharmeen Hussain for her commitment to translate the vision into action.&nbsp; &ndash; A great task accomplished.

														</p>

														<p>

															The last 31 years of Inner Wheel activities is a human story of the concerted efforts of many committed members in their clubs who have been determined to improve the quality of lives of the teeming multitude who live in absolute despair.

														</p>

														<p>

															World Inner Wheel Day shows other forms of service given by members and it is probably no exaggeration to say that each day in the year someone somewhere in the Inner Wheel world is offering a hand in service.

														</p>

														<p>

															Touching the lives of thousands with ground breaking services extended by the clubs, Inner Wheel District 328 story will always be only just the beginning.

														</p>

														<p>

															Fortunately we have the opportunity to participate in world affairs through our consultative status with the UN.&nbsp; We are represented on the NGO section of ECOSOC, which brings together a wide spectrum of professional and business associates, trade union, religious, youth and women&rsquo;s organization and other voluntary groups.&nbsp;&nbsp; With representatives in its 3 centres Geneva, New York and Vienna, we are playing an important role in changing todays world.

														</p>

														<p>

															Once again my heartiest felicitations to the District Executive Committee for launching the Website.&nbsp; A dynamic step towards advancement.

														</p>

														<p>

															The Website will serve as an effective mode of communication &ndash; reaching out to many, many members around the world.

														</p>

														<p>

															Let us enjoy the friendships, forge International understanding and implement the theme &lsquo;Commit with Conviction, Compassion and Consistency&rsquo;.

														</p>

														<p>

															In the friendship of Inner Wheel
